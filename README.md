# Regex-2-NFA
A program that takes a regular expression and creates an  NFA that accepts it. The description of an NFA should be compatible with a NFA 2  DFA program, which means that it can be translated into a form that can be run on a  DFA simulator.

# Setup and Run
run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

run `python main.py`
